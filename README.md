# NaiveBayesClassifier
Multinomial Naive Bayes

This implementation is of Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification.

The algorithm uses add-one laplace smoothing to prevent probabilities evaluating to zero.

Stemming is done to improve accuracy through NLTKâ€™s PorterStemmer.

Stopwords have been used to reduce the feature space as it adds little/ no information about text being as spam/ham.
